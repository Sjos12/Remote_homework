# Remote_homework
The Remote homework project is an attempt to revolutionize learning from home. With our versatile app, you would be able to upload pictures of you (home)work if you're struggling with it. Then people can place comments, audiofiles, or video ontop of your picture to try and help you. Ofcourse this is the very base of our idea and we will try to add many more feautures to improve the user experience.
